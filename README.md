### AI Engineer | Backend Builder | Curious Mind Turning Ideas Into Systems

*"Turning curiosity into working systems — sometimes elegant, sometimes chaotic, always learning."*

## About Me

I build intelligent systems, scalable APIs, and AI tools that try to survive real-world chaos.  
Sometimes they succeed. Sometimes they teach me why they didn’t.

##### Either way:  
> I learn.  
> I improve.  
> And I ship again.

I write code.  
I break it.  
I fix it better.  
And occasionally pretend that was the plan all along 😄

**Aspiring AI Engineer | Backend Developer**

##  Currently Building (and Definitely Debugging)

- Machine learning systems deployed with FastAPI  
- Backend architectures built to scale without drama  
- AI tools that automate real workflows  
- Experimental projects where failure isn’t scary — it’s data  

Some projects start as curiosity.  
Some become infrastructure.  
The strange ones become stories.

---

## What Drives Me

- Production-level AI deployment (beyond notebooks)  
- Backend systems that stay reliable under pressure  
- Performance optimization & clean architecture  
- Building tech that actually solves problems  

**Simple outside. Serious engineering underneath.**

##  What You’ll Find in My Repos

- ML models trained, deployed, debugged, improved  
- Backend systems with FastAPI & Django  
- Neural networks built from scratch (mistakes included)  
- Experimental AI automation projects  

Every repo = part experiment, part lesson, part progress log.

## 💭 Philosophy

> Build things that matter.  
> Break them intentionally.  
> Understand them deeply enough to rebuild them better.

Most bugs aren’t failures.  
They’re undocumented lessons.

And honestly… debugging teaches more than success ever did.

## 🧱 Dev Personality

- I actually enjoy debugging (yes, weird hobby)  
- I’ve trained models that predicted absolutely nothing — very confidently  
- I love elegant systems but secretly enjoy chaotic experiments  
- Dark theme user — obviously non-negotiable  

Confidence comes from fixing enough broken things  
to stop fearing them.

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python • C • Java • SQL  
**AI/ML:** PyTorch • scikit-learn • NumPy • Pandas • Streamlit  
**Backend:** FastAPI • Django • REST APIs  
**Databases:** SQLite (currently), exploring larger-scale systems  
**Tools:** Linux • Git • Bash • VS Code  

(And caffeine. Lots of caffeine.)

## 🧭 Final Note

Still learning.  
Still building.  
Still curious.

Because the goal isn’t just writing code —  
it’s understanding systems deeply enough  
to make them reliable, useful, and maybe even elegant.

And honestly…  
I just enjoy building cool stuff.
