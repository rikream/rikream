## Rikim Rana

AI engineer. Backend system builder. Occasional breaker of things that deserve to be rebuilt properly.

I build intelligent systems, scalable APIs, and machine learning applications that move beyond experiments into usable tools.

Some projects start as curiosity. The good ones become infrastructure.

---

## What I'm Building

- Machine learning models and deploying them with FastAPI  
- Backend systems designed to scale without collapsing under their own complexity  
- AI tools that automate real workflows  
- Systems that are simple on the surface and powerful underneath  

Also experimenting with ideas that may or may not work — those tend to teach the most.

---

## Current Direction

- Production-level AI deployment  
- Backend architecture and API design  
- Performance optimization  
- Building systems that remain reliable under pressure  

---

## Selected Work

My repositories include work on:

- Machine learning implementation and deployment  
- FastAPI backend systems  
- Neural networks built and trained from scratch  
- Experimental AI systems and backend tools  

Each project improves my understanding of how intelligent systems should actually be built.

## Philosophy

> Build things that matter.  
> Break things intentionally.  
> Understand systems deeply enough to rebuild them better.

Most bugs are not failures. They're documentation.

## Final Note

Still early in the process. Still building. Still improving.

The goal is simple: build systems that work — and understand why they work.
