### AI Engineer | Backend Builder | Curious Mind Turning Ideas Into Code

*"Turning curiosity into working systems — sometimes elegant, sometimes chaotic, always learning."*

## About Me

I build intelligent systems, scalable APIs, and AI tools designed to survive real-world chaos.  
Sometimes they succeed. Sometimes they teach me why they didn’t.

##### Either way:  
> I learn.  
> I improve.  
> And I ship again.

I write code. I break it. Then I rebuild it better — occasionally pretending that was the original plan.

## Currently Building

- Machine learning systems deployed with FastAPI  
- Backend architectures designed for scalability and reliability  
- AI tools that automate real workflows  
- Experimental projects where failure becomes useful data  

Some projects start as curiosity. The good ones become infrastructure.  
The strange ones usually become lessons.

---

## Current Focus

- Production-level AI deployment  
- Backend architecture and API design  
- Performance optimization  
- Building systems that remain reliable under pressure  

**Simple interface. Serious engineering underneath.**

## Engineering Work

My repositories include work on:

- Machine learning model development and deployment  
- Backend systems using FastAPI and Django  
- Neural networks built and trained from scratch  
- Experimental AI automation tools  

Each project improves how I design scalable, intelligent systems.

## Philosophy

> Build things that matter.  
> Break them intentionally.  
> Understand them deeply enough to rebuild them better.

Most bugs aren’t failures — they’re undocumented lessons.  
Debugging often teaches more than success ever does.

## Developer Personality

- I genuinely enjoy debugging  
- I’ve trained models that confidently predicted nothing useful  
- Elegant systems fascinate me, chaotic experiments motivate me  
- Dark theme user — non-negotiable  

Confidence comes from fixing enough broken systems to stop fearing them.

## Tech Toolbox

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python • C • Java • SQL  
**AI/ML:** PyTorch • scikit-learn • NumPy • Pandas • Streamlit  
**Backend:** FastAPI • Django • REST APIs  
**Databases:** SQLite  
**Tools:** Linux • Git • Bash • VS Code

Caffeine remains an essential runtime dependency.

## Final Note

Still learning. Still building. Still curious.

The goal isn’t just writing code —  
it’s understanding systems deeply enough to make them reliable, useful, and well-designed.

And honestly, I simply enjoy building things.
