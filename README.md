*"Turning curiosity into working systems — sometimes elegant, sometimes chaotic, always learning."*

## About Me

I build intelligent systems, scalable APIs, and AI tools designed to survive real-world chaos.  
Sometimes they succeed. Sometimes they teach me why they didn’t.

Either way:

I learn.  
I improve.  
I ship again.

I write code.  
I break it.  
I rebuild it better — occasionally pretending that was the original plan.

## Currently Building

- Machine learning systems deployed with FastAPI  
- Backend architectures designed to scale cleanly  
- AI tools automating real workflows  
- Experimental projects where failure becomes useful data  

Some projects start as curiosity.  
Some become infrastructure.  
The strange ones become stories.

---

## Current Focus

- Production-level AI deployment  
- Backend architecture and API design  
- Performance optimization  
- Building reliable systems under real-world pressure  

Simple interface. Serious engineering underneath.

## Engineering Work

You’ll find projects involving:

- Machine learning models trained, deployed, debugged, and improved  
- Backend systems built with FastAPI and Django  
- Neural networks built from scratch  
- Experimental AI automation tools  

Each repository represents experimentation, learning, and gradual improvement.

## Philosophy

> Build things that matter.  
> Break them intentionally.  
> Understand them deeply enough to rebuild them better.

Most bugs aren’t failures.  
They’re undocumented lessons.

Debugging often teaches more than success ever did.

---

## Developer Personality

- I genuinely enjoy debugging  
- I’ve trained models that confidently predicted absolutely nothing useful  
- Elegant systems fascinate me, but chaotic experiments keep things interesting  
- Dark theme user — non-negotiable  

Confidence comes from fixing enough broken systems to stop fearing them.

## Tech Toolbox

### Languages
Python • C • Java • SQL  

### AI / Machine Learning
PyTorch • scikit-learn • NumPy • Pandas • Streamlit  

### Backend Engineering
FastAPI • Django • REST APIs  

### Databases
SQLite (currently), exploring scalable database systems  

### Tools & Environment
Linux • Git • Bash • VS Code  

Caffeine remains an essential runtime dependency ☕

## Final Note

Still learning.  
Still building.  
Still curious.

The goal isn’t just writing code —  
it’s understanding systems deeply enough to make them reliable, useful, and well-designed.

And honestly, I simply enjoy building things.
